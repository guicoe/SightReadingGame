# Sight Reading Game

This is a sheet music reading game created on and for Pythonista 3 on iPadOS. It currently requires a hardware keyboard to play.

## Game Modes

There are currently two game modes supported. To switch modes, press cmd + M on the main screen.

### Blitz

In this game mode, you must enter as many correct notes as you can until the time runs out. The current note to be entered will be highlighted, and the next few notes in queue will be displayed so you can read ahead!

### Survival

In this game mode, you must quickly enter each note before a very short timer runs out. Each correct note entered will reset the timer for the next note. The game ends when the player fails to enter anything within the time limit, or if the player enters the wrong note.

## Controls

The current version of the game requires a hardware keyboard for its controls. Use the letters A through G to enter the corresponding notes in-game. To see a list of other controls, press and hold the command key.
